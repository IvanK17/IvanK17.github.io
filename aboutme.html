                <p>My name is Ivan Karev and I’m 19 years old. I am born and raised in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. I did my high
                    school studies in English Language School Plovdiv. In my free time I like to hang out with my
                    friends and work out in the gym. I have basic knowledge of C# and MySql.

            <div class="why">
                <h1>Why I chose to study ICT?</h1>
                <p>I assume that computer skills are in high demand these days and therefore there would be more
                    opportunities for realisation in IT fields in the future. Another thing that made me chose this
                    program is that I have always had interests in programming and solving compound computer problems. From very young age computers are part
                    of my life and if I have to follow the quotation from Steve Jobs <span>“The only way to do great
                        work is to love what you do!”</span>, my dream job would be something computer related. And last
                    but not least I believe that combining the skills I will obtain with the social skills I will
                    develop could make a huge impact on employers.</p>
