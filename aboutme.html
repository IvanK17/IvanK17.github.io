                <p>My name is Ivan Karev and I’m 19 years old. I am born and raised in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. I did my high school studies in English Language School Plovdiv. In my free time I like to hang out with my friends and work out in the gym. I have basic knowledge of C# and MySql.

                <h1>Why I chose to study ICT?</h1>
                <p>I assume that computer skills are in high demand these days and therefore there would be more opportunities for realisation in IT fields in the future. Another thing that made me chose this program is that I have always had interests in programming. From very young age computers are part of my life and if I have to follow the quotation from Steve Jobs <span>“The only way to do great work is to love what you do!”</span>, my dream job would be something computer related. And last but not least I believe that combining the skills I will obtain with the social skills I will develop could make a huge impact on employers.</p>
