            <h1>Briefly about me</h1>
            <article class="blog">
                <h2>Study choice</h2>
                <p>I made a research about the University and the town in order to make it clear for myself that this is the right choice. I assume that computer skills are in high demand these days and therefore there would be more oppurtunities for realisation in the future. Another thing that made me chose this program is that I have always had interests in programming. And last but not least I believe that combining the skills I will obtain with the social skills I will develope could make a huge impression on employers. My main goal is to found my own company and help the world be a better place. I haven't decided what I am goint to specialize in. My plan is to make my choice later during the study process. My expectations are to expand my knowledge in this field.</p>

                <h2>Personal SWOT analysis</h2>
                <p>My strenghts are that I am organised, creative, flexible, focused and a good teamworker. I don't think there would be any obstacles that could prevent me from achieving my goals, because when I am determined to succeed in something - I do it.</p>

                <h2>Programming experience</h2>
                <p>I have learned the basics of C# and MySQL in my high school. I can't say that I have any experience in the IT field but with the knowledge I will obtain during the study at HZ I am sure that I will become the best.</p>

                <h2>First feedback</h2>
                <p>Giving and recieving feedback is always the best way to help others to be a better version of themselves and besides everything to improve yourself. My first feedback made me realise what were my mistakes in the "Who am I" document and inspired me start thinking out of the box. </p>
