            <h1>Study choice</h1>
            <p>I researched the University and the town to ensure it's the right choice. Given the high demand for
                computer skills, there are abundant opportunities for future success. I've always been interested in
                programming, which influenced my decision to pursue this program. Moreover, combining technical skills
                with social skills could greatly impress potential employers. Ultimately, my main goal is to establish
                my own company and make a positive impact on the world. I haven't decided on a specialization yet; I
                plan to make that choice later during my studies. Overall, my expectations are to broaden my knowledge
                in this field.</p>
